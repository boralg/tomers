# Tomers - Rust Cross-Compilation Flake

Tomers is a Nix flake, that, when imported, sets up the right cross-compilation toolchains, dev shells, and builds, based on a user-defined list of targeted platforms.

## Examples
See https://github.com/thinnerthinker/sursface/blob/main/flake.nix for a WebGPU project compiled to various targets.
